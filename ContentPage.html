     <div class="historypara">
         <p>In all probability, music has played an important role in the 
             lifecycle of humans perhaps even before we could speak. 
             Significant evidence has been discovered that very early man 
             developed primitive flutes from animal bones and used stones and 
             wood as percussion. Voice would have been the first and most 
             natural means of expression in our distant ancestors, used to bond 
             socially or comfort a sleepless child. It is from these humble 
             beginnings that the music we enjoy today evolved. As we move 
             further through the history of music we find increasing evidence 
             of its key role in sacred and secular settings, although the 
             division into these categories was not define d in this way until 
             many years later.</p>
             <br>
             <p>Influences from the west to the east merged into the pre-Christian
                  music of the Greeks and later the Romans. Musical practices and 
                  conventions perhaps conveyed by travelling musicians brought a 
                  wealth of diversity and invention. Surviving Greek notation from 
                  this period of musical history has given scientists and musicologists 
                  alike a vital clue to the way that the music of the time might have 
                  sounded. It certainly indicates remarkable links to the music that 
                  would follow, perhaps most notably through the use of modality in 
                  Greek music.
                 In the frescoes and in some written accounts, including the Bible, 
                 we have learned about the instruments that featured in the Roman and 
                 Greek times and their significance to the cultures. The trumpet as an 
                 instrument of announcement and splendid ceremony, or the lyre as an 
                 integral player in the songs of poets.
                 Across Europe from the early part of the first century, the monasteries 
                 and abbeys became the places where music became embedded into the lives 
                 of those devoted to God and their followers.
                 Christianity had established itself and with it came a new liturgy that 
                 demanded a new music. Although early Christian music had its roots in 
                 the practices and beliefs of the Hebrew people, what emerged from this 
                 was to become the basis for sacred music for centuries to come. The 
                 chants that were composed devoutly followed the sacred Latin texts in 
                 a fashion that was tightly controlled and given only to the glory of 
                 God. Music was very much subservient to the words, without flourish 
                 or frivolity.
                 It was Pope Gregory (540-604 AD), who is credited with moving the 
                 progress of sacred music forward and developing what is now called 
                 Gregorian Chant, characterises by the haunting sound of the open, 
                 perfect fifth.
                 Some controversy surrounds this claim, but the name has stuck and 
                 the music remains distinct and vitally important as it moves away 
                 from plainchant towards polyphony. This, in turn, looked back to 
                 earlier times and customs, particularly in the music of the Jewish 
                 people where the idea of a static drone commonly underpinned a second 
                 vocal line.</p>

        <p>Music is an arrangement of a mixture of sound waves.  Basic properties of sound waves include frequency,velocity,wave length & amplitude. changing these properties even slightly changes the sound. So there are unimaginable number of variations that can be done to sound waves giving artists their freedom to create music that are unique and creative. There are 3 major characteristics of sound. They are Pitch,loudness and quality of sound. </p>

        <p id = "cont_pitch"><br><br><br><br>Pitch is the highness or the lowness of sound. Pitch depends on the frequency of the sound wave. Frequency is the time taken for a complete oscillation of a sound wave and
